# Types

Some people say JS shouldn't claim to have "types," and they should instead be called "tags" or perhaps "subtypes".

## Built-in Types

- null
- undefined
- boolean
- number
- string
- object
- symbol -- added in ES6!

**Note**: All of these types except object are called "primitives"(基本类型).

## typeof operator

```js
typeof undefined === "undefined"; // true
typeof true === "boolean"; // true
typeof 42 === "number"; // true
typeof "42" === "string"; // true
typeof { life: 42 } === "object"; // true

// added in ES6!
typeof Symbol() === "symbol"; // true

// It's special -- special in the sense
// it's buggy when combined with the typeof operator:
typeof null === "object"; // true

function func() {}
typeof func === "function"; // true
```

test for a null value using its type

```js
const a = null;
// (!a -> true)  a maybe false or null

!a && typeof a === "object"; // true
```

## undefined vs "undeclared"

Many developers will assume "undefined" and "undeclared" are roughly the same thing, but in JavaScript, they're quite different. undefined is a value that a declared variable can hold. "Undeclared" means a variable has never been declared.

JavaScript unfortunately kind of conflates these two terms, not only in its error messages ("ReferenceError: a is not defined") but also in the return values of typeof, which is "undefined" for both cases.

```js
const a;
a; // undefined
b; // ReferenceError: b is not defined
typeof a; // "undefined"
typeof b; // "undefined"
```

Check for the global DEBUG variable.The safety guard on typeof is our friend in this case.

```js
// oops, this would throw an error!
if (DEBUG) {
  console.log("Debugging is starting");
}

// this is a safe existence check
if (typeof DEBUG !== "undefined") {
  console.log("Debugging is starting");
}
```
